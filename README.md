# MyReads App

## About

This is the app that displays bookshelves and allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

The project consists of two screens. First one displays three book shelves with selected books. The second screen contains search input, where you can search for books and then add them to any category: currently reading, want to read or read.
